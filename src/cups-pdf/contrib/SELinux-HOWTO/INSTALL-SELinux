HOWTO: Enable CUPS-PDF to work with SELinux
-------------------------------------------
Security-enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a set of extensions to the standard Linux
kernel that add mandatory access controls to help prevent failures in system
security due to malicious or flawed applications. It is enabled by default on
Fedora Core 4 and 5, as well as other mainstream distributions. See
<http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/> for more background information.

In order to use CUPS-PDF with SELinux enabled, you will need to compile and
install the following security policy module:

$ cd cups-pdf-2.6.1/contrib/SELinux-HOWTO
$ ./update-module

Compiling type enforcement file 'cups_pdf.te' --> 'cups_pdf.mod'.
checkmodule:  loading policy configuration from cups_pdf.te
checkmodule:  policy configuration loaded
checkmodule:  writing binary representation (version 5) to cups_pdf.mod
Creating policy package 'cups_pdf.mod' --> 'cups_pdf.pp'.
Installing security policy 'cups_pdf.pp' into current machine policy.
cups_pdf        2.6.1

$ sudo service cups restart
Stopping cups:                                             [  OK  ]
Starting cups:                                             [  OK  ]

You should now be able to print via CUPS-PDF.

View the SELinux audit log to verify the newly-installed mandatory access
controls allow CUPS-PDF to print properly:

$ sudo tail -F -n 1000 /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep AVC

You should see various messages indicating security granted to the cupsd daemon.

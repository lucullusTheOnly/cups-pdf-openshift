	PSTITLEICONV v0.1 README

PSTITLEICONV is the CUPS filter for converting PostScript document embedded
title character encoding.


	INSTALLING

Copy pstitleiconv to the CUPS filter directory (usually /usr/lib/cups/filter).
Copy pstitleiconv.conf to /etc/cups directory (or modify pstitleiconv to use
your location)


	USAGE

PSTITLEICONV intended usage is in the filter chain before cups-pdf backend
to make international characters in the resulting filenames to appear
correctly.

Just add following line to the cups-pdf ppd file, somewhere near the top,
say, just after *Name definitions:

*cupsFilter:    "application/vnd.cups-postscript 0 pstitleiconv"

Then, specify source (client system) and target (host) character encodings
in the /etc/pstitleiconv.conf file (look there for details).


	COMMENTS

Parts of the code were inspired by or taken from cups-pdf CUPS backend.

Unfortunately, the author was not able to find a better way to pass
source and target encoding to the filter instance. So, for the time being,
configuration file /etc/cups/pstitleiconv.conf remains the only source, sorry.
If you could think of a better way, please inform me.
